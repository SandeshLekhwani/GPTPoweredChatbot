They have a firm conviction in the teachings of the Veda and are generous. A pandit is not swayed by anger, joy, pride, false modesty, stupefaction, or vanity, and remains focused on the four legitimate goals of life. They keep their projects and recommendations concealed from competitors and only reveal them after they have been accomplished. A pandit reflects daily on both virtue and success, prioritizing success over mere pleasure. They are strongly motivated, act to the best of their ability, and consider nothing as insignificant. A pandit understands quickly, listens patiently, pursues objectives with considerate planning, and does not waste time discussing the affairs of others without being asked. They know the impermanent nature of all creatures, the inter-connectedness of all acts, and the methodology for people to attain their objectives. A pandit speaks boldly, can converse on various subjects, knows the science of debate, possesses intellectual acuity, and can interpret the meaning of texts. Their studies are regulated by reason and they never abstain from paying respect to those who are good. A pandit draws wisdom from those who are wise and succeeds in achieving happiness by attending to both virtue and profit. Finally, a pandit, even after attaining immense wealth or vast learning, does not behave arrogantly.</b>"
